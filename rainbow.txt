this is a rainbow song.
I love this song very much.
I just added colors to my rainbow.
Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so.
He said his mother only smiled on her tv show.t
You are only happy when you are sorry head is filled with dope.
I hope you will make it to the day you are twenty eight years old.
